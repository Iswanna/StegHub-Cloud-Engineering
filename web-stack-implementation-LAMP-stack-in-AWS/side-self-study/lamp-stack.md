# LAMP Stack: An Overview

The LAMP stack is an acronym representing Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. It's a popular open-source software stack used for building and deploying dynamic web applications. Here's a brief breakdown of each component:

1. Linux: This operating system forms the base of the stack. Linux provides the environment for hosting web applications.
2. Apache: This is the web server software responsible for serving web pages to users' browsers. It handles requests from users and delivers the appropriate web content.
3. MySQL: This is the relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage the application's data. MySQL is commonly used to handle dynamic content on websites.
4. PHP: This serves as the scripting language on the server side used for developing dynamic web pages and web applications. PHP script is executed on the server, generating HTML content to be sent to the client's browser.

These components, working in harmony, form the LAMP stack, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for developing and deploying web applications. For instance, when a user requests a web page, Apache and PHP collaborate to handle the request and generate the HTML content, while MySQL manages the data needed for the page.
